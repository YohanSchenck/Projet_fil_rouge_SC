00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:23,350 
 Mr. President, we asked our viewers if they had questions here a couple. Jamie T. from Virginia said one of your biggest messages in campaign slogans was drain the swamp. But the idea that serving the American people is a privilege and not a career. And the politicians are supposed to answer to the American people and not the opposite. When will your administration be putting together a proposal for term limits for Congress? Well, we're looking into that right now. 

2 
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,710 
 Right now, I want to get those congressmen to go and 

3 
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,950 
 approve it about Obamacare and all the different things 

4 
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:28,950 
 that we're working on. 

5 
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,950 
 One step at a time. 

6 
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,950 
 We'll be doing it. 

7 
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,950 
 Really? 

8 
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,950 
 I mean, that's something down the road a little bit. 

9 
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,110 
 A lot of people don't like that. 

10 
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,150 
 Frankly, you know, they consider term limits to be an 

11 
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,430 
 election, but I think it would be a good thing. 

12 
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,910 
 But right now, what I want to do is get Obamacare approved 

13 
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,930 
 and I want people to love us approved or change. 

14 
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,650 
 Well really well changed when I say Obamacare, I mean I'm talking about real change and 

15 
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,450 
 I suspect the first thing that's going to change will be the name, but we're talking 

16 
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,890 
 about repealing and replacing and if we don't do that I would be very upset. 

17 
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:1,240 
 Nobody's going to get thrown out of their insurance, are they? 

18 
00:01:1,240 --> 00:01:2,880 
 Because that's what a lot of people are saying. 

19 
00:01:2,880 --> 00:01:4,400 
 On the left, they're saying millions of people 

20 
00:01:4,400 --> 00:01:5,240 
 are gonna lose the insurance. 

21 
00:01:5,240 --> 00:01:6,080 
 No, they have it all wrong. 

22 
00:01:6,080 --> 00:01:7,960 
 And you're gonna hear about it during the speech, 

23 
00:01:7,960 --> 00:01:8,880 
 but they have it all wrong. 

24 
00:01:8,880 --> 00:01:12,560 
 We're gonna have a really great healthcare plan, 

25 
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560 
 and it's gonna be much more affordable. 

26 
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,200 
 Including for the country. 

27 
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,960 
 Now, I know when you were inaugurated, 

28 
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,630 
 you put your hand on your Bible 

29 
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,350 
 that your mother had given you as a child. 

30 
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,230 
 I know as a mother, as parents, 

31 
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,310 
 we pray for our children, 

32 
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,950 
 we want the best for them and your parents, 

33 
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,190 
 they probably pray for you so much, 

34 
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,790 
 but maybe not, they might not have realized 

35 
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,870 
 that you were gonna get this far, 

36 
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,670 
 and I know they would be very proud of you. 

37 
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,030 
 That leads me to this question. 

38 
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,810 
 Ronald wrote us and said, I pray for you daily. 

39 
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,850 
 Do you take time to pray? 

40 
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,370 
 I do, actually, and to me, it's very important. 

41 
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,810 
 But that's so nice, who is that? 

42 
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,650 
 That's Ronald. 

43 
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,650 
 Wow, hello, Ronald. 

44 
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,490 
 We ought to bring Ronald to the White House. 

45 
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,610 
 He'd be happy to come. 

46 
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,530 
 I like Ronald. 

47 
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,010 
 And this is the last one. 

48 
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,680 
 Alan Sherman from Queen says, I'm a diehard New York Mets fan since you're a native of the Great Barrow of Queens 

49 
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:3,680 
 But move to Manhattan are you a Mets fan or a Yankees fan the fate of the world relies on this answer? 

50 
00:02:3,680 --> 00:02:11,720 
 Well, I don't think it does, but actually I do like both teams and I love this time Burner family and the Will Pond family and Randy Levine and the whole group 

51 
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,030 
 They Randy has done a terrific job. He's involved with the Yankees. 

52 
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,630 
 Now you're probably going to win New York? Well, I don't know, but I do like both teams. 

53 
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,070 
 I really do. What about social security? People might are worried that it might run out by the 

54 
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,190 
 time we need it. You're going to be okay. That was Ainsley from Manhattan.
